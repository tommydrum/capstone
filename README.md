Simple inventory management application for keeping inventory levels (and prices) of Parts and Products.

This has a JavaFX frontend, using AWS Cognito for its authentication service.

The backend uses the serverless framework, along with cognito authorizer in the api gateway, to authenticate API calls. The backend simple interfaces with a MySQL database.
